    	<h2 class="text-center">Beef</h2>
    	The protein comprised in one daily serving of red meat contains the amino acids you need for muscle building and tissue repair. Protein also assists in producing the enzymes and hormones that are required by your body to help to prevent illness. Protein consumption has also been linked to weight loss due to its ability to satisfy hunger and reduce appetite after being eaten. Iron contained in red meat is more easily absorbed by the body, making red meat the best source of iron for your body. Iron is essential for our red blood cells to deliver oxygen to the cells in our bodies. Iron is well known for its ability to assist our bodies in avoiding anaemia, a condition by which a person’s body has insufficient healthy red blood cells. Iron also assists our bodies in providing immune strength, and various bodily benefits. Iron deficiencies can lead to fatigue, weakness, peptic ulcers and a weakened immune system. Beef also contains a healthy dosage of zinc, which is an essential mineral that we need to perform various bodily functions. Zinc supports normal development during infancy, childhood and adolescence. B-Vitamins promote various functions of the body. Red meat contains B-12, which promotes a healthy nervous system, B-6 for a healthy immune system, niacin which aids our bodies digestive system, and riboflavin which promote healthy skin and eyes.

    	<h2 class="text-center">Sushi</h2>
    	Sushi is a dish enjoyed by people all over the world. It’s a Japanese staple that has been around for over 700 years. Though there are a seemingly endless number of variations, most sushi is often considered to have a number of surprising health benefits. Sushi is known for having high amounts of concentrated forms of omega-3 fatty acids. This is perhaps the most sought after and cited benefit of sushi. These fatty acids act as a “good” form of cholesterol that helps to prevent clogged arteries. Omega-3 has also been linked to helping lower blood pressure. The types of sushi that are especially rich in omega-3 include lake trout, herring, tuna, and salmon. Many sushi rolls are wrapped in thin sheets of seaweed—or nori in Japanese. Seaweed contains a number of healthy minerals, the most prominent of which is iodine. This key mineral is an essential part of our diet and is especially important to the proper function of our thyroid glands. Though too much iodine can have negative effects, a proper level—like that found in seaweed—helps balance hormones and optimize metabolic activities. Fish is high in protein and low in fat and calories. This is a combination that is great for our metabolism. Low-calorie, high-quality proteins can significantly boost our body’s ability to function properly, create new cells, and metabolize energy, which keeps us strong and healthy. Fish is not the only component of sushi. Although the toppings and ingredients can vary from roll to roll, most sushi rolls are served with wasabi and ginger, which both have anti-carcinogenic properties because of their antioxidant compounds. These antioxidants are capable of neutralizing free radicals and, therefore, eliminating their ability to mutate into cancer cells. On top of this, the trace mineral selenium, which is found in sushi, is reported to have anticancer properties as well. As we mentioned, sushi is more than fish. Two ingredients that are almost always paired with sushi are wasabi and ginger, and both of these ingredients have antibacterial properties. This means that if there is any concern about freshness or unwanted bacteria, these two antiviral agents can potentially help to kill off bacteria, which, in effect, helps boost your immune system. Iron is found both in fish and soy sauce—two key elements of sushi. When you eat foods that are high in iron, it can boost your red blood cells, specifically by promoting the production of them. The more red blood cells you have, the better your circulation, metabolism, skin tone, hair growth, and ability to heal is.
